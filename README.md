# Inventory Analytics Project

This project solves inventory inefficiencies using SQL and Power BI. It includes:

- Normalized SQL schema
- Data cleaning & transformation scripts
- Power BI-ready KPIs and reports
- Demand forecasting support

## Structure
- `sql/` → schema and insert scripts
- `data/` → raw dataset (ignored in Git)
- `README.md` → this file

Let me know if you want a sample `README.md`, zipped folder, or automatic push with GitHub CLI!
